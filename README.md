# MoonShot
Introduction
We had so many chances to become millionaires. We missed Bitcoin. We missed Ethereum. We missed Dogecoin. We missed Shiba Inu. If only we knew about these coins when they first we minted! It is easy to hear about a coin after its value has multiplied by 10, 100 or even 1000. But how do we find these coins when they are first released? How do we find the Bitcoins of the crypto world when they are worth pennies instead of thousands?

Look no further. Introducing MoonShot, an app designed to locate promising crypto coins at the infancy of their project development.
